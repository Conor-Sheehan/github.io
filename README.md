Climate and Mood is a Data Science tutorial on the entire fundamental data science pipeline. Our goal in this tutorial is to study the relationship between Mood or Overall Well-Being and the Climate where we live. As humans, we are often likely to think that our mood is strictly a factor of the conditions of our everyday life. I would like to explore whether or not the environment that we live in has a larger effect on our disposition then we realize.

I created this exciting tutorial to explore several facets of our climate including average temperature across seasons as well as the rainfall in relationship to social, emotional, and financial well-being of the people in different cities across the United States.

Read the complete Mood and Climate Tutorial and Data Study within the On_Mood_and_Climate.md file. I added all graphical plots as .pngs on the github repo. Enjoy my tutorial!
