## Studying Mood and Climate to learn Data Science Fundamentals

This tutorial is meant to act as a walkthrough for fundamental Data Science practices, while discovering new insights on the relationship between mood within different climates within the United States. Before we really dive into the code portion, I'm going to layout exactly what we're studying in this tutorial.
      
          
          
####                                                                        Mood
Since there are many ways to think about Mood I'm going to break it into three main categories: Personal Well-Being, Social/Communal Well-Being, and Financial well-being. Personal well-being is the overall emotional, mental and physical wellness that people have. While, communal wellness is based on the strength of social ties as well as the time that people spend together. Financial well-being is the overall quality of career satisfaction and income to support a comfortable lifestlye. All three kinds of well being are essential for the balance of a fulfilled life.
     
     
####                                                                       Climate
Climate is the overall trends of weather in a region over a long period of time. Climate is created through multiple variables creating distinct patterns over time such as longitude, latitude, terrain, altitude, and nearby bodies of water. Here's a link to NASA's page on climate:   

https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/noaa-n/climate/climate_weather.html


#### My Prediction
Due to all of these variable, climates can be extremely varied and difficult to directly compare. But, in this study we will explore whether there is a correlation between certain types of climates and mood of the population by that area and climate. I hypothesize that there will be a correlation between certain types of climate and moods. We will explore variables including average temperature over different time intervals, precipitation and snowfall in that region.

## Let's get started!

To get started we first need to collect our data. In this tutorial we will focus on scraping data from websites because it's so versatile.
We'll start by learning basic R pipelines for scraping data and parsing it into neat data frames. This first example will be scraping a website that contains data on the climate for 100 cities across the United States.      


Here's the link:      
https://www.infoplease.com/science-health/weather/climate-100-selected-us-cities

```{r scrape_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output.var= "Climate_table_cleaned"}
library(tidyr)
library(rvest)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

# Store the URL into a variable we can use later
Climate_URL <- "https://www.infoplease.com/science-health/weather/climate-100-selected-us-cities"


# Here is our first major pipeline for scraping data off websites
climate_table <- Climate_URL %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_node("table") %>% #This line acts as a css selector to locate the table in the web page
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
  set_colnames(c("City","Avg_Temp_January","Avg_Temp_April","Avg_Temp_July","Avg_Temp_October", 
                 "Precipitation_inches", "Precipitation_days", "Snowfall", "Observed_Days")) %>%
  as_data_frame ## Converting to easy to use R data frame


Climate_table_cleaned <- climate_table[-c(1, 2),]

Climate_table_cleaned$Avg_Temp_January = as.numeric(as.character(Climate_table_cleaned$Avg_Temp_January))
Climate_table_cleaned$Avg_Temp_April = as.numeric(as.character(Climate_table_cleaned$Avg_Temp_April))
Climate_table_cleaned$Avg_Temp_October = as.numeric(as.character(Climate_table_cleaned$Avg_Temp_October))
Climate_table_cleaned$Precipitation_inches = as.numeric(as.character(Climate_table_cleaned$Precipitation_inches))
Climate_table_cleaned$Precipitation_days = as.numeric(as.character(Climate_table_cleaned$Precipitation_days)) # Here's our first table!
Climate_table_cleaned

```

## Success! Now, let's get data on Mood across Cities
Excellent, now that we collected data on the climate we will also need to also gather data on mood across different cities in the United States to unite these data sets for analysis. I found an interesting article on WalletHub that collected cumulative metrics and calculate overall happiness in different cities. They rate happiness off of emotional well-being, income, and communal well-being to calculate an overall score.

     
Here's the link:
https://wallethub.com/edu/happiest-places-to-live/32619/

Now, that we are clear on our data, let's scrape this site as well for their happiness metrics.

```{r scrape_data2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output.var="Mood_table_cleaned"}
library(tidyr)
library(rvest)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

# Store the URL into a variable we can use later
Mood_URL <- "https://wallethub.com/edu/happiest-places-to-live/32619/"


# Here is our second major pipeline for scraping data off websites
Mood_table_cleaned <- Mood_URL %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_node("table") %>% #This line acts as a css selector to locate the table in the web page
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
  set_colnames(c("OverallRank","City","Total_Score","Emotional_WB_Rank","Income_WB_Rank", "Communal_WB_Rank")) %>%
  as_data_frame ## Converting to easy to use R data frame

Mood_table_cleaned

```

## Now we have our core data to begin analytics. Let's do some categorization and parsing..
But, first we must parse the data, so that we can easily work with both of these two tables to explore my the relationship between Mood and Climate. So, right now we have two different studies from two different sources. Therefore, there will be some incongruency in the way they categorized and display data. For starters, we have data in the form of U.S cities, which is great, but doesn't tell us anything about climate. Also, both studies may have studied durastically different cities, therefore we need a way to unite the data. So, we will break up data into states so that the data is easier to analyze. 

```{r parse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output.var="United_Table"}
library(tidyr)
library(rvest)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

## Let's seperate the City columns of both tables into their respective cities and states.
Regional_Mood_table = separate(data = Mood_table_cleaned, col = City, sep = ",", into = c("City", "State"))
Regional_Mood_table

Regional_Climate_table = separate(data = Climate_table_cleaned, col = City, sep = ",", into = c("City", "State"))
Regional_Climate_table 


# Group Climate table by state 
State_Climate_table <- Regional_Climate_table %>% group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(Avg_Temp_April = mean(Avg_Temp_April), Avg_Temp_January = mean(Avg_Temp_January), Avg_Precipitation_inches = mean(Precipitation_inches), Avg_Precipitation_days = mean(Precipitation_days))
State_Climate_table

# Group Mood table by state
State_Mood_table <- Regional_Mood_table %>% group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(Emotional_WB_Rank = mean(Emotional_WB_Rank),Communal_WB_Rank = mean(Communal_WB_Rank), Income_WB_Rank = mean(Income_WB_Rank), 
            Overall_WB_Rank = (Emotional_WB_Rank+Communal_WB_Rank+Income_WB_Rank)/3)


#Next we need to standardize the state column abbreviations, so that we can join the tables for data analysis.

State_Mood_table$State_std = c("AK","AL","AR","AZ","CA","CO","CT","DC","DE","FL",
                               "GA","HI","IA","IL","ID","IN","KS","KY","LA","MA",
                              "MD","ME","MI","MN","MO","MS","MT","NC","ND","NE",
                              "NH","NJ","NM","NV","NY","OH","OK","OR","PA","RI",
                              "SC","SD","TN", "TX","UT","VA","VT","WA","WI","WV",
                              "WY")
State_Mood_table

State_Climate_table$State_std = c("AL","AK","AZ","AR","CA","CO","CT","DC","DE","FL",
                               "GA","HI","IA","ID","IL","IN","KS","KY","LA","ME","MA",
                              "MD","MI","MN","MS","MO","MT","NC","ND","NH",
                              "NJ","NM", "NY", "NE","NV","OH","OK","OR","PA","RI",
                              "SC","SD","TN", "TX","UT","VA","VT","WV","WA","WI",
                              "WY")
State_Climate_table

United_Table <- merge(State_Mood_table,State_Climate_table, by = "State_std")

# Now we finally have data that we can run EDA and look for trends in the data
United_Table %>% slice(1:10)
```
## EDA

Now, that we have successfully tidied and standardized to form one united data table, we can finally start doing EDA and looking for trends in the data. We'll start by making basic plots of a few key variables of interest. We have set out to explore whether or not mood correlates to climate, but first we need to understand how mood and well being is related to weather on a basic level. So, we're going to make some basic plots to investigate. Consider in the first two plots that the Mean Emotional Well Being and Communal Well Being are taken from an article which ranks them from 1-180, so the lower score the better. Whereas, the third plot of overall well-being is based off of a total score calculated by the study, so the higher the score the better. So, the first two should be an inverse view of the third.



####Overall Well-Being Rank Vs. Average Temperature in January by State (Lower Rank is Higher Well Being)
```{r plot_overall, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output.var="United Table"}
library(ggplot2)


United_Table %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Avg_Temp_January, y=Overall_WB_Rank, label = State_std)) + geom_text() + geom_smooth(method = lm)


```


#### Initial Examination and EDA
After looking at our plotted data, it seems that any kind of linear relationship between Average Winter Temperature and Overall Well-Being can be ruled out. Our data across these three plots appears to take on more of a bell-shaped curve that would be best fit by a higher degree function than linear, but let's do some statistical analyses to see if this prediction is correct.

#### Linear model summaries of winter temperature vs well-being
```{r stats, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output.var="United Table"}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)

# These next to steps are calculating a linear model for average january temperature vs. Overall Well Being.
regr_model <-  lm(United_Table$Avg_Temp_January ~ United_Table$Overall_WB_Rank)
regr_model

summary(regr_model)
```

####Poor Linear Fit
So, we can see through our fit by the adjusted R-Squared value, a linear model only explains about 1% of the variance in the regression fit. Also, our p-value is relatively high and would not match a 5% standard of significance for a linear fit between these two variables.

##Let's try a new way
The stat_smooth function in the ggplot methods is used to predict a best fit model for data that is more complex to analyze. 
```{r plot_stat, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output.var="United Table"}
library(ggplot2)


United_Table %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Avg_Temp_January, y=Overall_WB_Rank, label = State_std)) + geom_text() + geom_smooth()

```
   
##Much better fit.
As we can see with this updated plot it appears that the best fit for Winter weather vs Overall Well-Being would be a type of polynomial function along the lines of f(x) =-(x^2 - 80 x + 1480). The geom_smooth function automatically defaults to a prediction within a 95% confidence interval for best fit, but as we can see it is a bell-shaped curve somewhat similar to a normal distribution.     
   
   
####Some Findings
After finding the curve of best fit for our plot and ruling out a direct linear correlation, we can breakdown some interesting concepts in relation to the topic at hand. Counter-intuitive to my initial thoughts warmer year round weather (as predicted by warmer winter temperatures) do not predict overall happiness and well-being in the United States. According to our best fit curve, it appears that living in weather with more extreme (higher and lower) temperatures actually predict higher rates of well-being across state populations. Obviously, there are many factors with climate that can be also be factored in including rainfall, temperatures throughout other times of year, and proximity to the coast (large bodies of water). Because this is a Intro Data Science tutorial and there are many factors besides temperature to climate we will explore more variables

####Overall Well-Being Rank Vs. Precipitation by State (Lower Rank is Higher Well Being)
```{r plot_rain, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output.var="United Table"}
library(ggplot2)


United_Table %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Avg_Precipitation_inches, y=Overall_WB_Rank, label = State_std)) + geom_text() + geom_smooth(method = lm)
```
##Better linear fit
It appears that a linear fit for yearly rainfall and overall well being could be a better fit then for temperature in the winter time, so let's run a quick statistical analysis as well as a regression plot to see.

#### Statistical analysis and regression model for Precipitation vs. Well Being
```{r stats_rain, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, output.var="United Table"}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)

# These next to steps are calculating a linear model for average precipitation vs. Overall Well Being.
regr_model <-  lm(United_Table$Avg_Precipitation_inches ~ United_Table$Overall_WB_Rank)
regr_model

summary(regr_model)

# Create augmented regression model for plotting
augment_regr <- augment(regr_model)

augment_regr %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(United_Table$Avg_Precipitation_inches), y=.resid)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title="Residual Plot",
         x = "Rainfall",
         y = "residuals")
```

## Questionable Linear Fit.
So, after running our statistical summary on overall well being vs. precipitation our p-value is much less than the 5% upper bound confidence for a linear fit, but this model only accounts for about 26% of the variation of our fit. Also, after plotting the residuals, it appears that the data is not independent randomly distributed about the line x = 0. It appears that there is a positive linear trend within the residual plot, which may mean that a linear model is not the best fit for our data.

##Climate is complex
After running statistical analyses on two different kinds of trends within our data we can see that basic weather patterns do not necessarily have a quickly interpretable correlation with overall mood and well-being. This is because climate is made up of many variables and so to truly do an in depth breakdown we would most likely need to create a variable that is inclusive of many different weather and location factors that effect climate.
